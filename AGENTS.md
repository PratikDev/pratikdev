# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Vite React portfolio app written in TypeScript. Application entry points live in `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`. Global styles and Tailwind CSS setup are in `src/index.css`. Reusable UI primitives belong in `src/components/ui/`, following the current shadcn-style component layout. Shared utilities belong in `src/lib/`, such as `src/lib/utils.ts`. Static top-level configuration includes `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.js`, and `components.json`. Build output is generated in `dist/` and is ignored by linting.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Bun as the package manager because this repo includes `bun.lock`.

- `bun install`: install dependencies.
- `bun run dev`: start the Vite development server.
- `bun run build`: run TypeScript project checks with `tsc -b`, then create a production Vite build.
- `bun run shadd <component-name>`: add new shadcn UI components to the project.
- `bun run lint`: run ESLint across the repository.
- `bun run preview`: serve the production build locally for verification.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write TypeScript and TSX with strict compiler settings. TypeScript and React components should be in `.ts` and `.tsx` files. Prefer function components and named exports for reusable UI, matching `src/components/ui/button.tsx`. Use the `@/` path alias for imports from `src`, for example `@/components/ui/button` and `@/lib/utils`. Keep utility functions small and colocated under `src/lib/`. Component names should use PascalCase, hooks should use `useCamelCase`, and general variables/functions should use camelCase. Try to avoid `any` or `unknown` types as much as possible. Keep **EVERYTHING** type-safe. Never make a single file too long. Do code splitting with easily manageable/understandable file structure. always follow DRY strategy for everything. Whether it's a type/interface declaration or even a simple utility function. Never write same logic in multiple places. and keep everything easily extensible. CSS should primarily use Tailwind utility classes and CSS variables defined through the existing shadcn/Tailwind setup. If any css color is needs to be used that isn't available in `src/index.css` already, never use tailwind arbitrary values. always declare them as variables in `src/index.css` and use those variables in the classnames. For any frontend related task, use shadcn/ui components as much as possible.

## Testing Guidelines

No test runner or test script is configured yet. For now, validate changes with `bun run lint` and `bun run build`. When adding tests, prefer colocated files named `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`, and add an explicit `test` script to `package.json` so future contributors have one standard command.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly. For tracked files run `git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. For brand-new files, use the one-liner `git restore --staged :/ && git add "path/to/file1" "path/to/file2" && git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. Always check the changed files by `git status` before committing. Never commit files from the thread context. Never change any file content before committing. PRs should explain user-visible impact, list schema or config changes, and link related issues. Pull requests should include a short summary, validation steps, and linked issues when relevant. Note any schema, environment, or migration impact explicitly.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Keep edits scoped to the requested change. Do not rewrite generated shadcn UI primitives unless the task requires it. Before changing shared styling or config, check `components.json`, `src/index.css`, and the relevant TypeScript config so new code follows the existing setup.
